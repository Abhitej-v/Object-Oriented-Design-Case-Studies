# Real-World-Backend-Projects

Here you will find some my complex and interesting real-world projects. Any constructive feedback is appreciated.



Technologies/ Frameworks / Languages / Tools / Concepts Used:

1. Object oriented programming: Used many concepts like inheritance, polymorphism etc.., of OOPs everywhere in these projects

2. Java: Used java to implement the OOPs logic

3. UML: Created a UML class diagram for each project which helps to breakdown and easily design the system.

4. Operating System: Demonstrated the understanding of concepts like data inconsistency due to interrupts. How it is tackled using concepts like storing critical information in the disk space rather than in cache.  Not allowing multiple threads of OS to access the critical section at the same time. Applied concepts of java like "volatile" to achieve it.

5. Computer Network: Demonstrated the concepts of over the network transaction in ATM design. Used standard design patterns like proxy design pattern and network  libraries in java like RMI, serializable.

6. Design Patterns: Applied many relevant design patterns at places where they fit in exactly for those design challenges.
